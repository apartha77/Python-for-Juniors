# Day 2 - Intermediate Coding Time!!! 

### The __init__() method (constructor)
### The self keyword
### Instance attributes vs class attributes (briefly introduce)
### Encapsulation (public and private members)
### Instance methods

We will take example of Bank Account Class

Create a BankAccount class that demonstrates:
- The use of __init__()
- Encapsulation of balance (private variable)
- Instance methods for deposit and withdrawal


``` python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute using name mangling

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited ₹{amount}. New balance is ₹{self.__balance}")
        else:
            print("Enter a valid amount to deposit.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ₹{amount}. Remaining balance is ₹{self.__balance}")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds or invalid amount.")

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance


# Creating an account
acc = BankAccount("Alice", 5000)
acc.deposit(1500)
acc.withdraw(2000)
print("Final balance:", acc.get_balance())

# Trying to access private variable directly
# print(acc.__balance)  # This will throw an error


```
- What does __init__() do and when is it called?
- Why do we use self?
- Why is __balance private and how does that help?
- What happens when we try to access a private attribute directly?

### Practice - Create Student Grade Tracker
Create a class called Student with the following:
Attributes:
- name (string)
- roll_number (string)
- __grades (private list)

Methods:
- add_grade(grade) – adds a grade (0-100)
- get_average() – returns average of grades
- display_info() – prints name, roll number, average grade
- get_grades() - to return the full list of grades
- Restrict grades to 0–100 using a check


```python
# Skeleton for Students to Fill
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_number):
        pass  # implement constructor

    def add_grade(self, grade):
        pass  # implement with validation

    def get_average(self):
        pass  # compute and return average

    def display_info(self):
        pass  # print name, roll and avg grade

# Try creating objects and using methods

```

You can even assign a value to a variable and it would become boolean

```python
bln = (10 > 9)
print(type(bln)) # Output: <class, 'bool'>
```


## Day 2 - Exercise

1. Imagine two values and try to use various different operators like `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=` etc to check the output by using `print()` function.
