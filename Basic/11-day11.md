# Day 11 - Coding Time!!! 

### Let us use whatever we learnt so far and put them in action. 

Find Prime numbers - Iterate through all the numbers starting from 2 to (N/2) using a for loop and for every number check if it divides N. If we find any number that divides, we return false. If we did not find any number between 2 and N/2 which divides N then it means that N is prime and we will return True.

```python
num = 21
a = num//2+1
print(a)
# Negative numbers, 0 and 1 are not primes
if num > 1:
    # Iterate from 2 to n // 2
    for i in range(2, (num//2)+1):
        # If num is divisible by any number between
        # 2 and n / 2, it is not prime (between 2-9)
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(num, "is not a prime number")
            break
    else:
        print(num, "is a prime number")
else:
    print(num, "is not a prime number")
```
#### Let us do some more -
Warmup - create a list of even numbers only from the list provided. 
``` python
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b=[]
for x in a:
    if(x % 2==0):
        b.append(x)
        
print("list of even numbers", b)
# how to the code will work with minimum change to get odd numbers
```    
- How get the odd numbers with minimum change to the above code - Can you do it?

### Palindrome - 
Now we can play with strings. Write a code to check if a given word is Palindrome - example "MADAM"

```python
string = "madam"
for l in string:
    print ("one letter: " + l)

#Create a function to reverse the work
def reverse(word):
	rev = ''
	for i in range(len(word)):
		rev += word[len(word)-1-i]
	return rev
# Take the word as input from user
word = input("Please enter a word: ")
# Call the function you created above with parameter
rev = reverse(word)
print("Input word is ", word + "  reverse word is", rev )
if rev == word:
	print("This word is a palindrome")
else:
	print("This word is not a palindrome")
```

### The same can be done by reversing the string as we did for list. 
``` python  
#take input the word from user
word=input("Please enter a word: ")
reverse=word[::-1]
print(reverse)
if word == reverse:
    print("This word is a palindrome")
else:
    print("This word is not a palindrome")
```   

# Code with Lists 
Find Odd Even Numbers in a given list. 
``` python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Iterate through each element in the list
for val in a:  
  # Checks if a number is divisible by 2 (i.e., even).
  if val % 2 == 0:
    print(val)
```

We have learned lot of list operations - let us use exists, compare etc.
```python
#Check if number exists in the list 
a = [5, 10, 15, 20]
print (10 in a)
print (2 in a)

b = [5, 8, 15, 21]
result = []
#You can of course use this in loops
for x in a:
    if x in b:
        result.append(x)
print(result)
```        
#### We will use random number to generte the list
```python
# Create random list
import random

c = []
d = []
for x in range(0,11):
    c.append(random.randint(0, 20)) #crete the list with random numbers in the defined range
    d.append(random.randint(3, 24))
    c.sort()
    d.sort()
print(c, '\n', d, '\n')
```
We have either a 
-range or 
-series to be used in for. 

# Guessing game
Let us create a guessing using random number generation. Generate a random number between two numbers, example 10 and 50. Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. Continue the game going until the user guessed the number and keep track how many guesses user has taken.

We will use random and do while loop today
```python
import random

rdnum = random.randint(10,50)
print(rdnum)
guess = 0
counter = 0
while guess != rdnum:
    guess = int(input("Enter a guess between 10 to 50 : "))
    counter += 1
    if guess < rdnum:
        print("Too low")
    elif guess > rdnum:
        print("Too high")
    else:
        print("Right!")
        print("You took only", counter, "tries!")

```
