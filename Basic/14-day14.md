# Day 14 - Coding Time!!! 

### How Modules Works

In **programming** language module means **reusability** without writing same thing again and again, how can you call a previously written block of code from different places of your application? The purpose is to reduce the number of lines of code and reuse existing code.

Let's see how modularity works in `Python`. If you have the below code and save to a file `hellomodule.py`, then you can use the name of this file as **Python** module.

```python
#Funtion to be called
def sayHello(name):
    print("Hello "+name)
```

In this case it will be `hellomodule`. Notice here we are not using `.py` extention in the module name.

How you can call the code,

```python
import hellomodule

hellomodule.sayHello("World")
```

In python you can also name a module and use shorter name, like below

```python
import hellomodule as h

h.sayHello("World")
```
