# Day 4 - Operators 

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators

Complete the exercises with all the operators from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp)

## EduBlock 
Now moving back for our EduBlocks to continue with Turtle - 

“Turtle” is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a pen to draw and move around the board using set functions.
To get started, we need to build the background for our pen, or turtle as we will now call it.
Import the turtle, then we need to identify the turtle and screen settings.
The numbers (255, 0, 0) in the screen colour block are the Red, Green, Blue (RGB) colour values, so:
- 255, 0, 0 is Red
- 0, 255, 0 is Green
- 0, 0, 255 is Blue
We have changed the screen background colour to “black.”

The final step here is to add a block to alter the speed of the turtle.

## Turtle Exercise 
Now we will create text based Turtle code. If required we will create the same in Block base, othwerwise we will stick to Text base code.

Complete the exercises from  [PythonClassroom](https://www.pythonclassroom.com/turtle-graphics/turtle-example) to create 
- Square
- Cirle
