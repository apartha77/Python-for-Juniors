# Day 5 - Continue Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries

### Continue Lists 
Complete the exercises with all the list from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)

Let us revise the variables - complete the exercises from [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types)

Now we will do the exercises on Lists [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Lists)

### Loop Lists - for, while loops

We will revise **for** loop and use to loop through the list. 

```python
PlaceList = ["Kolkata", "London", "New York"]
print(PlaceList)
```
Now we will print one by one
```python
PlaceList = ["Kolkata", "London", "New York"]
for x in PlaceList:
    print(x)
```
We already know how to call list items by their index. Now, to loop through we might want to know the how big the list is, we can use range() or len() functions to decide how many times to loop through. 

Let us try with **while** loop
```python
PlaceList = ["Kolkata", "London", "New York"]
i=0
while i<len(PlaceList):
    print(PlaceList[i])
    i = i+1 # increase the value of i (index)
```
Now we will use **Looping Using List Comprehension** shorter sytax to achieve the same as loop
```python
PlaceList = ["Kolkata", "London", "New York"]
[print(x) for x in PlaceList]
```

Let us now, complete the exercises with all the examples for List Comprehension from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp)

We will learn List **Sort, Copy, Join** next week. 


## Tuples 
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are *** List, Set, and Dictionary,** all with different qualities and usage.

Tuple items are **ordered, unchangeable,** and allow **duplicate** values.

```python
myTuple = ("Kolkata", "London", "New York")
print(myTuple)
```
Tuples has similar index, len() function, check the example [W3Schols](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp)


## EduBlock 
Now moving back for our EduBlocks to continue with Turtle Iteration -
