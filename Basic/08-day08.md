# Day 8 - Introduction to Dictionaries. Revise List, Tuples, Sets. Find odd/even and prime numbers 

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

#--------------------------- 8th Class - 15th Dec -------------------------------------

Let us complete the exercise here [Class-Works](https://app.edublocks.org/project/2PgJC1xT7FQhR35obp4zUBMNNFh1/m96OSCNxN3P3kN1h3V0y)

```python
# Odd Even Numbers in a given list. 
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Iterate through each element in the list
for val in a:  
    # Checks if a number is divisible by 2 (i.e., even).
    if val % 2 == 0:
        print(val)
```

Now let us find Prime numbers -
- Iterate through all the numbers starting from 2 to (N/2) using a for loop. 
- And for every number check if it divides N. If we find any number that divides, we return false.
- If we did not find any number between 2 and N/2 which divides N then it means that N is prime and we will return True.

``` python
num = 11
# Negative numbers, 0 and 1 are not primes
if num > 1:
    # Iterate from 2 to n // 2
    for i in range(2, (num//2)+1):
      
        # If num is divisible by any number between
        # 2 and n / 2, it is not prime
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(num, "is not a prime number")
            break
    else:
        print(num, "is a prime number")
else:
    print(num, "is not a prime number")
```
