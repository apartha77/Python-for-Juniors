# Day 1 - Beginning

Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in 1991. Since then there are enhancements getting added. Current Python version is 3 which we will be using in our learning (please check for lastest version while using).

We can install python in our computers or we can use online browser based editors. We will use what is available online for free such as [Edublocks](https://app.edublocks.org/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/), [Learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/), [PythonClassroom](https://www.pythonclassroom.com/). There are many more, you may explore and choose any. 

As we are starting from beginner level, we will start with **Block Based** and gradually move to **Text Based** coding. 

Let us start the some Theory about Python first
- Example of Print()
- Syntax, Comments
- Variables
- Data Types 
- Numbers
- Casting
- Strings, Booleans
- Operators
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- If...Else
- While Loops
- For Loops
- Functions 

We will start with the basic `print()` command and we will print different texts in the Python window.

```python
print("Hello Everyone")
```
On the first day we will get comfortable with Python and use it by simply printing some text. This will help us get used to this new way of working with computers, that is programming in computers and Python interpreter.


In next classes we will understand how we can use variable to store the text and use it again and again.


## Day 1 - Exercise

1. Print your name in the python interpreter window.
2. Print your favourite movie name.
3. Print the name of your school.
