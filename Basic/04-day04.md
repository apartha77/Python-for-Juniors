# Day 4 - String Concatenation, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries

### String Concatenation

What happens when we use (`+`) with Text values (`str`)

```python
print('first name' + 'last name')
```

### String Exercise

1. Declare your first name in a variable. 
2. Declare your last (surname) in another variable.
3. Add them and store in a variable.
4. Print the 3rd variable in Python window.

### List

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

```python
PlaceList = ["Kolkata", "London", "New York"]
print(PlaceList)
```
**List Items** - 
List items are **ordered**, **changeable**, and allow **duplicate** values.

List items are **indexed**, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
- List Length ``` len() print(len(PlaceList))```
- List Items - Data Types - string, integer, boolean ``` list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]```
- The list() **Constructor** let us understand 
```python
PlaceList = list(("Kolkata", "London", "New York"))
print(PlaceList)
```
