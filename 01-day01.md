# Day 1 - Beginning

Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in 1991. Since then there are enhancements getting added. Current Python version is 3 which we will be using in our learning (as of 2024).

To start python you need to open **Command** prompt in **Windows** and then type `python` or `python3` or `py`

Here we will learn the basic `print()` command and we will print different texts in the Python window.

```python
print("Hello Everyone")
```

On on the first day we will get comfortable with Python and use it by simply printing some text. This will help you get used to this new way of working with computers, that is programming in computers.

I will highly recommend that with the guidance of your seniors, practice it for some time until you get comfortable. Then follow the exercises below to have fun with Python interpreter.


In next exercise we will understand how we can use variable to store the text and use it again and again.

To clear the Python prompt type `cls` in **Windows** and `clear` in **Linux**.

When you are done then you can use ```exit()``` to come out of Python Interpreter

## Day 1 - Exercise

1. Print your name in the python interpreter window.
2. Print your favourite movie name.
3. Print the name of your school.
4. Close the Python window and open it again to print the name of your favourite food.
